# Optimization method for the long-term utility of all HSs, subject to the stability of energy queue.

The optimization method is divided into two stages. 
Firstly, we use an improved deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to obtain the offloading decision. 
Secondly, to motivate UAVs to participate in resources sharing, a contract has been designed for asymmetric information scenarios. 

`Contract-basedDQN.py` is used to evaluate offloading decision in the DQN algorithm.

`HS_utility.py`, `UAV_utility.py` and `social_welfare_utility.py` are used to evaluate the performance of the contract.

`IC_IR_proof.py` verified the effectiveness of IC and IR.
